# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project

The purpose of this project is to take the data set provided and perform the manipulations and transformations necessary to meet the listed project objectives, which also results in a final tidy data set.

The files contained within datasciencecoursera/GetAndCleanData/ are the required files for submission to complete the assignment.  Descriptions of the files are as follows:

CodeBook.md
> The code book provides a description of the objectives of the project, the type of data contained in the project files, the location of the original research project website, the location of the original data source files, the data files used in this tidy data project, the variables contained in the original research data set, the variables selected for in this tidy data project, and the transformations used to meet the objectives of the course assignment. 

mean_measures_by_activity_subject.csv
> This csv file contains the final tidy data set resulting from execution of all transformations needed to satisfy all objectives of the course assignment.

README.md
> README provides a description of all files in datasciencecoursera/GetAndCleanData/ that make up the course assignment submission.  

run_analysis.R
> The run_analysis script contains the R instructions for manipulating the original activity data set.  Included comments split the file into sections based on stepwise completion of the course assignment objectives.  When the script is executed with 'UCI HAR Dataset' in the home directory, a txt file of the final tidy data set will be created and written to the home directory.
